# LCA
Assignment 1 - Software Engineering Java/Python

LCA PYTHON REPOSITORY LINK -> https://github.com/nacarney/LCA-Python-

1. I got my Java and Python Implementation of LCA from this site:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-in-a-binary-search-tree/

2. I got my Python toString function code from this link: 

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-string-brackets/

3. I got my Java printNodesInOrder and printNode function from an implementation I completed last year of a BST (Algorithms and Data Structures Assignment 2) 

# LCA 2
 I merged my DAG branch correctly and it worked with my main branch. 
 
 I got a lot of my code/ info from Algorithms 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick (especially BFS, reverse functions)
